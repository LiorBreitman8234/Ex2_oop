### Ex2 OOP
In this project we will work on a Weighted Directional Graph. <br>
See files here - https://github.com/benmoshe/OOP_2021/tree/main/Assignments/Ex2/src/api <br>
We need to implement four algorithms: <br>
1. Shortest path between two nodes (return weight of path or list of nodes in path)
2. Center node of graph 
3. Is connected - is there a path between every two nodes in the graph 
4. Traveling Sales Man problem
